# burger

**Overview**

This full stack browser app is a burger logger using MySQL, Sequelize and Node to query and route data, Handlebars to generate HTML and Express for server management.

**How to Use**
1. Burger is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
2. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
3. Each burger in the waiting area also has a `DEVOUR BURGER` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
4. The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
